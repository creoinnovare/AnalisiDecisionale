## What Data We Collect

Analisi Decisionale **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data**.  
All data you create within the app — including decision events, notes, reflections, and action steps — is stored **locally on your device** (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch).

We do not use third-party analytics, ad networks, or trackers.

---

## How Your Data Is Stored

- Your data remains securely on your device.  
- The app offers optional export features (CSV, JSON) that allow **you** to choose what to export and where to share or save it.  
- Deleting the app from your device will permanently delete all app data stored locally.

---

## WatchOS Companion App

The Apple Watch app works in direct connection with your iPhone.  
No data leaves your devices during normal use.

---

## Third-Party Services

We do not use third-party services or cloud storage within the app.

---

## Your Rights and Control

As a user, you:
- Maintain full ownership and control over your data.
- Can delete your app data at any time by deleting the app from your device.
- Can choose when and if you want to export your data.

We do not collect any identifiable information, so we do not maintain or store any user records.

---

## Changes to This Policy

If we introduce features in the future (e.g., optional cloud sync), we will update this privacy policy and notify users accordingly.

We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
