# Analisi Decisionale — User Guide

Welcome to **Analisi Decisionale**, a decision support tool designed to help you capture rationale, analyze outcomes, and reflect with structured insight.

---

## Getting Started

Upon opening the app, you'll be presented with your list of decisions. You can create a new decision entry or tap an existing one to explore its details.

---

## Key Areas of the App

### 1. Decision Summary

Each decision includes:

- **Title** – A short descriptor of the decision.
- **Expectation** – What you anticipate will happen.
- **Outcome** – What actually happened, filled in after the event.
- **Tags** – Add keywords to organize and filter decisions.

A dashboard at the top of each decision offers a quick overview including tag highlights, timeline access, and insight indicators.

---

### 2. Action Steps

Plan and track tasks related to your decision:

- Tap `+ Add Step` to enter a new task.
- Each step includes a title, due date, and completion status.
- Tap a step to mark it as complete or edit details.

This area helps ensure progress is tied to key outcomes.

---

### 3. Insights Tab

This is a reflection and analysis zone with two core types:

#### a. Field Notes

Capture informal observations, ideas, risks, or data points. Each note can be tagged and filtered later.

- Tap "New Note" or switch to the *New Note* tab.
- Add tags and insight types for categorization.
- Tap an existing note to view or edit.

#### b. Reflections (PMN)

Use the **Plus, Minus, Next** framework:

- **Plus** – What worked well
- **Minus** – What didn’t
- **Next** – What to do differently next time

Tap "New Reflection" to open a structured entry view. Entries are grouped and color-coded by type.

---

### 4. Timeline View

Chronologically displays decisions, field notes, and reflections to see how your thinking and results evolve over time.

---

### 5. Dev Controls (Development Mode Only)

Access developer tools for inserting test data or resetting the app environment. This is only available in debug or developer builds.

---

## Tips for Use

- Use tags consistently to improve filtering and search.
- Record reflections shortly after decisions conclude.
- Use Action Steps to bridge intention and execution.

---

## Reference & Background

### The PMN Framework: Plus, Minus, Next

The **Plus, Minus, Next** (PMN) method is a lightweight reflection framework introduced in *Tiny Experiments* by Anne-Laure Le Cunff. It encourages rapid, structured feedback on actions, projects, or decisions.

It includes three elements:

- **Plus (+)** – What went well? What should be celebrated or repeated?
- **Minus (–)** – What didn’t go as expected? What challenges emerged?
- **Next (→)** – What will you do differently next time? What ideas or adjustments came from this experience?

### Why It’s Useful

PMN supports clarity in thinking, emotional processing, and continuous improvement. It is particularly effective for:

- Project debriefs
- Daily/weekly reviews
- Learning summaries

The structure also makes it easier to revisit past decisions and observe patterns in outcomes and mindset over time.
