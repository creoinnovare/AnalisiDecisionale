## Reflection Framework: PMN

### What Is PMN?
The **Plus / Minus / Next** model was introduced to my workfow after reading _Tiny Experiments_ by Anne-Laure Le Cunff. It's a fast, accessible way to reflect:

- **Plus (+)** ‚Äì What went well?
- **Minus (‚Äì)** ‚Äì What didn‚Äôt go as planned?
- **Next (‚Üí)** ‚Äì What would you do differently?

### Why Use It?
PMN helps clarify experiences, capture lessons, and support growth. It‚Äôs great for:
- Project reviews
- Learning reflections
- Decision improvement
