# Analisi Decisionale â€” User Guide

Welcome to **Analisi Decisionale**, a structured decision support tool designed to help you capture rationale, track actions, analyze outcomes, and reflect through structured insight.

---

## Getting Started

When you first open the app, youâ€™ll see your Decision List. This list may be empty to start â€” tap the **+** button in the top-right corner to add your first decision. You can also insert an example decision using **Dev Controls** (gear icon).

---

## Core Concepts

### Decision Event
- The central unit of thought: a single decision, plan, or idea
- Includes a title, date, and optional expectation/outcome summary

### Field Notes
- Used to record insights, inputs, or questions that influenced the decision
- Supports tags and types (e.g., "question", "evidence") for later filtering

### Reflections
- Based on the **Plus / Minus / Next (PMN)** model
- Helps you evaluate what worked, what didnâ€™t, and what to improve

## Key Areas of the App

### 1. Decision Summary
Each decision shows:
- **Title** â€“ A concise summary

A dashboard provides insight counts, tag usage, and access to the timeline.

### 2. Action Steps
Use this area to manage key tasks:
- Tap **Add Step** to define a new task
- Steps include title, due date, and completion status
- Useful for linking intentions to actual execution

### 3. Insights View
This screen helps you analyze your decision over time:

#### a. Field Notes
- Capture moments, risks, questions, and ideas
- Tap **New Note** or use the quick-entry field
- Add tags and insight types for filtering and searching

#### b. Reflections (PMN)
- Tap **New Reflection** to access the Plus / Minus / Next entry
- Entries are grouped by type and visually color-coded

### 4. Timeline View
Visualizes the sequence of notes and reflections to help you understand how decisions evolve.

## Reflection Framework: PMN

### What Is PMN?
The **Plus / Minus / Next** model was introduced in _Tiny Experiments_ by Anne-Laure Le Cunff. It's a fast, accessible way to reflect:

- **Plus (+)** â€“ What went well?
- **Minus (â€“)** â€“ What didnâ€™t go as planned?
- **Next (â†’)** â€“ What would you do differently?

### Why Use It?
PMN helps clarify experiences, capture lessons, and support growth. Itâ€™s great for:
- Project reviews
- Learning reflections
- Decision improvement

It also creates a consistent language for future reviews.
